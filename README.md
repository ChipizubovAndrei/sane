# sane
Educational implementation of neuroevolutionary SANE-algorithm Designed to Adjust the Weight Parameters of a Single-Layer Feedforward Neural Network.
Project was made within course of Neuroevolutionary Computing in Tomsk Polytechnic University.
</br>

### Used packages
---
For working of algorithm and neural net model:
1. numpy=1.16.4
2. matplotlib=3.1.0
3. scikit-learn=0.23.2
</br>

### Features
---
- Training single-layer network using SANE-algorithm
- Visualisation of training metrics
- Saving the best models of models
- Logging metric values in the learning process, saving hyperparameter values
</br>

### SANE-Algorithm
---
SANE can be used to evolve single-layer feedforward neural network that consists of a single hidden
layer.
Used algorithm can be found in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00114722).
